# ðŸš€ Creating a Web app For My Classification Model  ðŸš€


## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to create and deploy an application for my classification model. During the model training process, I selected the Logistic Regression Model and incorporated it into a pipeline.

## What you will find in this repository
- The source code can be found in the src folder
- I used the Virtualevn Python environment
- The model can be found in the model folder

### Manual Setup

You can clone this repo

For manual installation, you need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system.Then you create a virtual environment and install requirements.txt file


- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

 Run the gradio app (being at the repository root):
        
  - Gradio:
    
    - src

          src\app.py
